"""One writer per journal.

A paper or live loop keeps cash and the open position in memory and writes them
to its journal. Two processes on one journal each believe they own the money,
and both will act on the same signal. This lock makes the second one refuse to
start.

It uses ``flock`` rather than a pid file: the kernel releases the lock when the
process exits for any reason, including a crash or a closed terminal, so there
is never a stale lock to clean up and no window between "check" and "take".
